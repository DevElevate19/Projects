# Weather Data Fetcher

A simple Python script to fetch and display weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API. It allows interactive input of coordinates and date range and lets you query specific weather details.

## About

I made this project quickly after finishing class tests, so I was a bit stressed and didn’t put in too much effort to make it fancy or perfect. Midsem exams were coming up soon, so I didn’t think much about updating or improving it further.

Later on, I found the project quite boring to complete and concluded it wasn’t worth putting more hard work into it. So I haven’t marked it as fully completed, and instead started looking for other projects that I find more interesting.

This script is mainly a learning exercise to practice API requests, JSON handling, and user interaction in Python.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Input the coordinates (latitude,longitude).
3. Input the date range (YYYY-MM-DD format).
4. Query the weather info by typing a keyword or type "tell" to list all available data.
5. Type "exit" at any prompt to quit.

## Notes
