## About

This was my first small project when I started at IIT KGP. I was really excited and just made it in my free time. Itâ€™s a simple text-based program to practice Python input handling, lists, and looping.

## Features

- Add expenses with amount, category, date, and optional notes.
- View all recorded expenses.
- Search expenses by category.
- Save and exit option (currently just ends the program).

## How to Use

- Run the Python script.
- Follow the menu to add expenses, view all, search, or exit.

- Only basic error handling; it expects correct input formats.

## Notes

- This is a beginner-level project made for learning purposes.
- It does not currently save data to a file.
- The interface is console-based and simple.
