Just a bunch of small coding projects I'm working on as I learn the basics.

I'm in my first year of engineering and still pretty new to programming, so most of this stuff is just me trying to understand how things work—random experiments, and practice problems.

Some of it might be messy or not fully working (yet), but that’s all part of the process. Hopefully, over time, these projects will show how much I’ve improved.
